    "# Practicum: Modern Hopfield Network Spell Checking and Word Recommendation\n",
    "___\n",
    "In this practicum problem, we'll implement a modern version of a Hopfield Network, which is a type of recurrent neural network, and we'll use it for spell checking and word recommendation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* _What are Hopfield Networks_? Hopfield Networks are used for associative memory, where the network can recall a pattern from a partial input. The modern version of Hopfield Networks uses continuous values instead of binary values, and it can store multiple patterns. \n",
    "* We'll use the following paper to guide our implementation and analysis: [Ramsauer, H., Schafl, B., Lehner, J., Seidl, P., Widrich, M., Gruber, L., Holzleitner, M., Pavlovi'c, M., Sandve, G.K., Greiff, V., Kreil, D.P., Kopp, M., Klambauer, G., Brandstetter, J., & Hochreiter, S. (2020). Hopfield Networks is All You Need. ArXiv, abs/2008.02217.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02217)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tasks\n",
    "Before we get started, we'll quickly review modern Hopfied Networks. Then, you'll execute the `Run All Cells` command to check if you (or your neighbor) have any code or setup issues. Code issues, then raise your hands - and let's get those fixed!\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Task 1: Setup, Data, Constants (5 min)__: Let's take 5 minutes to load [a Simpsons character library from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kostastokis/simpsons-faces) that our Hopfield network will memorize.\n",
    "*  __Task 2: Build a Modern Network Model (5 min)__: In this task, we'll formulate the image dataset we give the network and then create a model of a modern Hopfield network. We'll also quickly check to ensure we are doing what we think we are doing.\n",
    "* __Task 3: Retrieve a memory from the network (30 min)__: In this task, we will retrieve a memory from the modern Hopfield network starting from a random state vector $\\mathbf{s}_{\\circ}$. We'll corrupt an image (by cutting off some fraction of the image) and then see if the model recovers the correct memory given the corrupted starting point. \n",

    "## Background\n",
    "A modern Hopfield network addresses many of the perceived limitations of the original Hopfield network. The original Hopfield network was limited to binary values and could only store a limited number of patterns. The modern Hopfield network uses continuous values and can store a large number of patterns.\n",

    "### Algorithm\n",
    "The user provides a set of memory vectors $\\mathbf{X} = \\left\\{\\mathbf{x}_{1}, \\mathbf{x}_{2}, \\ldots, \\mathbf{x}_{m}\\right\\}$, where $\\mathbf{x}_{i} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is a memory vector of size $n$ and $m$ is the number of memory vectors. Further, the user provides an initial _partial memory_ $\\mathbf{s}_{\\circ} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$, which is a vector of size $n$ that is a partial version of one of the memory vectors and specifies the _temperature_ $\\beta$ of the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Initialize__ the network with the memory vectors $\\mathbf{X}$, and the inverse temperature $\\beta$. Set current state to the initial state $\\mathbf{s} \\gets \\mathbf{s}_{\\circ}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Until convergence __do__:\n",
    "   1. Compute the _current_ probability vector defined as $\\mathbf{p} = \\texttt{softmax}(\\beta\\cdot\\mathbf{X}^{\\top}\\mathbf{s})$ where $\\mathbf{s}$ is the _current_ state vector, and $\\mathbf{X}^{\\top}$ is the transpose of the memory matrix $\\mathbf{X}$.\n",
    "   2. Compute the _next_ state vector $\\mathbf{s}^{\\prime} = \\mathbf{X}\\mathbf{p}$ and the _next_ probability vector $\\mathbf{p}^{\\prime} = \\texttt{softmax}(\\beta\\cdot\\mathbf{X}^{\\top}\\mathbf{s}^{\\prime})$.\n",
    "   3. If $\\mathbf{p}^{\\prime}$ is _close_ to $\\mathbf{p}$ or we run out of iterations, then __stop__. For example, $\\lVert \\mathbf{p}^{\\prime} - \\mathbf{p}\\rVert_{2}^{2} \\leq \\epsilon$ for some small $\\epsilon > 0$.\n",
    "   4. Otherwise, update the state $\\mathbf{s} \\gets\\mathbf{s}^{\\prime}$, and __go back to__ step 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "   \n",
    "This algorithm is implemented in [the `recover(...)` method](src/Compute.jl)."

    "## Task 1: Setup, Data, and Prerequisites\n",
    "We set up the computational environment by including the `Include.jl` file, loading any needed resources, such as sample datasets, and setting up any required constants. \n",
    "* The `Include.jl` file also loads external packages, various functions that we will use in the exercise, and custom types to model the components of our problem. It checks for a `Manifest.toml` file; if it finds one, packages are loaded. Other packages are downloaded and then loaded."
